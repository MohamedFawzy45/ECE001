        <h2>What are Types of Operating System?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Batch Operating System</b></li> <div>Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming. To speed the same process, a job with a similar type of needs are batched together and run as a group.<br>The user of a batch operating system never directly interacts with the computer. In this type of OS, every user prepares his or her job on an offline device like a punch card and submit it to the computer operator. </div> <br>
            
            <li><b>Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems</b></li> <div>Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time. The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing. </div> <br>
            
            <li><b> Real time OS </b></li> <div>A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems. </div> <br>
            
            <li><b> Distributed Operating System </b></li> <div> Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its users.  </div> <br>
            
            <li><b> Network Operating System </b></li> <div> Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.  </div> <br>
            
            <li><b> Mobile OS </b></li> <div> Mobile operating systems are those OS which is especially that are designed to power smartphones, tablets, and wearables devices.<br> Some most famous mobile operating systems are Android and iOS, but others include BlackBerry, Web, and watchOS. </div> <br>
